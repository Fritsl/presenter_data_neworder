/*
  # Comprehensive Theme Management System

  1. Changes
    - Implements proper theme cycling for root notes
    - Ensures themes are correctly inherited when notes are moved
    - Fixes stack depth issues when deleting notes with many children
    - Creates robust triggers for theme updates with cascading effects

  2. Details
    - When a note is moved to a new parent, it inherits the parent's theme
    - Root-level notes maintain their own themes
    - Child notes automatically inherit themes from their parents
    - Recursive operations are handled safely to prevent stack depth errors
